# LearningC

I was bored, and thought it would be fun to learn C, for the raw POWER, and PERFORMANCE that C gives.
I'd like to build a compiler someday, so I thought it'd be best to start learning now!

There's four mini-projects here, I'll go into each of them:

## Calculator

Old reliable. Get input from user, do the math.
Taught me:
- How to get user input
- How to print to the console
- Arithmetic and variables

## Tic-Tac-Toe

The classic game!
